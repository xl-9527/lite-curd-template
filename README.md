# lite-crud-template

In my recent development, I often have some quick and flashing ideas, but I have to create projects&config every time with repetitive requirements. In my opinion, it is a waste of time. At this time, I suddenly had the idea of maintaining a template for rapid development. I have also used some open source templates in my hierarchy, which are very comprehensive, large, and well packaged. However, for me, I always feel that they are a bit too big and developed for rapid development, lacking a lot of developer soul.
## Some initial ideas

The technology used
- spring-boot 3.3.2
- mybatis 3.0.3
- docker
- mysql 8.0

Front-end technology usage
- vue3
- vite
- ts
  Develop a set of frameworks based on the above technologies that can be quickly developed, while also providing opportunities for developers to showcase their skills
